# Baseboards

Here you'll find prototype baseboards for Meadow and Netduino. These baseboards are designed specifically to hold a Meadow or Netduino and a standard [Half+ size breadboard](http://amzn.to/2fMEgGH):

For those with dual extruders, we've included both the base and the logo as separate files for dual extrusion merging.  

Use the `Baseboard_Meadow.stl` file to print:

The logo for dual extrusion is in `Baseboard_Meadow_Logo.stl`.
