Additionally, there are various peripheral models for use in designing enclosures and whatnot.

## Note on Source File Types

Newer file types are [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) `.f3d` files. Fusion is free for non-commercial use and is both powerful and easy to use. 

Some older source file types are AutoCAD `.dwg` files. We've generally moved away from AutoCAD in favor of Fusion 360.
